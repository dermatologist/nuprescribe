# Notes

## Java 10 Spring Boot Application.

## If spring boot is in a submodule.
* mvn install in the parent folder
* mvn spring-boot:run in the subfolder

## Multimodule Application
* So far I have been successful in making a single module java 10 application work.
* Use [this repository](https://github.com/dermatologist/java10-springboot-maven-modules) for multimodule applications.

## May be I should wait till Java 11 is available and Spring-Boot multimodule support is well documented.
